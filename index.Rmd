Hello! This is Yunlin Zhou. I am a new graduated MS student in Biostatistics (*Theory & Method track*) from the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.

In the past semesters, I took data analysis courses including R, SAS and Python programming, as well as software skills in Access and MySQL. I also took advanced statistical methods courses like longitudinal data and causal inference. Recently I am working with Prof. Kara Rudolph on a project, of which the idea is to estimate the longitudinal association between disability denial rates and overdose death rates and the extent to which these longitudinal associations differ by cost of living.

In addition to my data analysis and technical skills, I also have extensive experience working with research teams. Throughout my prior undergraduate work at the Beijing Forestry University, I worked as a research assistant for almost 4 years. In this role, I took part in 3 programs and published an article and a review as the second author.

From this website, you can see my previous courses, projects and publications.
